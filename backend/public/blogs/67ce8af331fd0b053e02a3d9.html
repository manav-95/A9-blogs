            <p><p><span style="font-size: 20px">I coded my first program when a single kilobyte was considered luxurious memory.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px">Now, I want to reminisce about the “good” old days, reflecting on where and how programming has progressed over the decades. And by “good,” I mean objectively terrible in almost every measurable way. Terrible, yes, but paradoxically valuable: what didn’t kill you made you better. Having survived, I am all the better.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px">I did not just adapt to the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn’t see an IDE until I was already a man.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px">My first code was on a Sinclair ZX81 in BASIC. Early 80s. Yes, I am aging myself. Remember those? That tiny British computer with its membrane keyboard and 1KB of memory. ONE KILOBYTE. You kids, with your gigabytes of RAM, you have absolutely no idea. I’d spend hours typing in programs only to lose them when I accidentally kicked the power cable. That was programming in its most primal form: coding with a side order of prayer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px">But my education in digital masochism didn’t stop with home computers. As I graduated high school, I graduated to new levels of programming purgatory. Try writing Fortran on an IBM 360 using an offline terminal with 8-inch disks. Not punchcards, mind you — I narrowly escaped that particular circle of programmer hell, though I’ve held those ancient artifacts in my hands. The 8-inch disks were the ‘modern’ alternative. You’d meticulously code your program on an off-line terminal, turn the disc into the computer center, and then… wait. A full day of anxious anticipation only to get your printout back with ‘SYNTAX ERROR LINE 42’ staring at you. One misplaced comma, one forgotten + in the 6th column, and you’d lose another day. We measured our feedback loops in days, not milliseconds.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: source-serif-pro, Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; color: rgb(36, 36, 36)"><span style="font-size: 20px">Then came the era of ‘user-friendly’ programming, and I use those quotation marks with all the irony they deserve. In the early days of IDEs, I remember TurboPascal with genuine affection. That blue screen felt like magic compared to the bare command lines and text editors I’d been battling. It was a miracle — instant feedback! Compile errors in seconds rather than days! But even TurboPascal was a far cry from what we call IDEs today. It was more like a fancy text editor with a ‘compile’ button strapped to its side. Still, that garish blue screen represented genuine progress, and I loved it despite its limitations.</span></span><span style="font-size: medium"><br></span></p></p>
